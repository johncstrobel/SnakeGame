# SnakeGame
 
A version of the classic game Snake that I made in a week for fun.

Not all of the bugs are ironed out, suffers from the occasional crash. Could use a lot of polishing still, we will see if I find the time to add more features.

To run: download the folder that is appropriate to your operating system (for example, SnakeGame/application.windows64), then just run the .exe inside. You might need to install java 8 for it to work correctly.

Controls: arrow keys. Click the game to pause/unpause. Game starts paused. When you die the game exits, just re-run it to play again!
